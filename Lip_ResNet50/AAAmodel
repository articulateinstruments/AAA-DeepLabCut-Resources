// (string) Display name for the model
name:ResNet50: Upper-Lip (5pt), Lower-Lip (5pt)

// (comma separated integers) Description of how the points form contiguous splines,
//  eg. 0,1,2;2,5,4 would mean the first 3 points which the model returns form a single contiguous spline, and then 3rd, 6th and 5th points form a second spline with its points in that order, which also shares a point with the first spline (the 3rd point). You can do arbitrary overlaps and ommissions this way, and specify the points in any order.
points:0,2,4,6,1;0,3,5,7,1
// (comma separated strings) Names of each AAA spline to be used or created in loading from this model.
splinenames:DLC_LipUpper,DLC_LipLower

// (float, optional parameter) The average Mean Square Distance (MSD) in millimetres between the model and human-labelled ground-truth, from research.
accuracy:19.0
// As this model is for Lip tracking, the above value refers to the Lip aperture MSD in square-millimeters (mm^2)

// (integer) The millisecond round-trip time from AAA to DLC and back. This parameter is updated automatically every time the model is used from AAA.
latency:44

// (integer in the range 0-2) What behaviour should be used to handle differences of aspect-ratio.
//  0 = Squash the image to fit
//  1 = Crop the long axis of the image to fit
//  2 = Letterbox pad the short axis of the image to fit
aspect:2

// Currently unused; not read by or written from AAA
